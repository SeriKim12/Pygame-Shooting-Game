# Pygame-Shooting-Game
- Horror theme of py-shooting game team project during 5 days.
- final_final is the code of the game, and final_zip is the images and bgm files for the game.
- You can play the game to download the exe file.
- Since it took only 5 days for us to make and all of us are not majored computer science, it's not as perfect or great as you might expect.
- Hope you enjoy it :)
